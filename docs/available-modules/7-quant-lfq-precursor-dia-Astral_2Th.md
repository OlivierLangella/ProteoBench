DIA quantification - precursor ions - Astral_2Th data
This module compares the sensitivity and quantification accuracy for data-independent acquisition (DIA) data, namely All-Ion Fragmentation (AIF), on a Q Exactive HF-X Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher). Users can load their data and inspect the results privately. They can also make their outputs public by providing the associated parameter file and submitting the benchmark run to ProteoBench. By doing so, their workflow output will be stored alongside all other benchmark runs in ProteoBench and will be accessible to the entire community.

This module is not designed to compare later-stages post-processing of quantitative data such as missing value replacement, and we advise users to publically upload data without replacement of missing values and without manual filtering.

We think that this module is more suited to evaluate the impact of (non exhaustive list):

search engine identification
peak picking
low-level ion signal normalisation
Other modules will be more suited to explore further post-pocessing steps.
